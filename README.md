# research2023
codebase for functions and for analyzing the LINCS dataset and TCGA gene expression and clinical data. 

There are two separate README's. One is for a general overview of the LINCS project, the other is more of my day-to-day musings so I can keep track of what I've been doing. Please look at the week synopses I insert for more relevant information to my research project.
